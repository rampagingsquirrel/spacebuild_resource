<p id="entryheader">YOUR FIRST SPACEBUILD PLANET</p>
<p id="entrytext">
I started mapping first in Doom, and picked up an interest in mapping for Source for the ability to make my own
worlds. It's for this reason that I find Spacebuild mapping particularly exciting because I actually CAN make my own worlds:
whole planets for people to explore, conquer and enjoy. I often see new mappers on the Facepunch forums asking how to make a
Spacebuild map, and planets are the meat and potatoes of your typical Spacebuild map. Fortunately, with the Planet Dev Kits
provided first by Shanjaq and now Pelf, the hardest part is already done!<br><br>

For this tutorial we're going to go step by step through the creation of your first spacebuild planet using Pelf's awesome Planet 
Dev Kit, which you can find <a id="hyperlink" href="files/EnhancedDevKit.zip">HERE</a>. Let's get started....<br><br><br>

<b>First Things First...</b><br><br>
If you haven't already, open up Pelf's Planet Dev Kit and extract the files to someplace convenient. I keep them in a folder on my desktop
as I'm always using them. Start up Hammer and open up one of the prefab planets from the kit. Select All, and then Copy. Close out the 
prefab file and open a new map, then paste the prefab into the new map.<br><br>

<b>Bordering On Insanity...</b><br><br>
So now that we have our platform on which to build the planet, the next thing we need to do is make a border that prevents players from
just walking off the edge of the planet. This is done easily with the Arch tool. On top of your planet, make a new brush the same size of
your planet and set the arch tool to 12 sides. Set the texture to 'tools/clip.'<br><br>

<img src="images/firstplanet/pic2.png"><br><br>

Place the mouse cursor over the outline of the brush and press enter. You'll be prompted with the Arch Properties menu. Enter the values 
below:<br><br>

Click ok, and there's your border! You'll notice that with Pelf's prefabs the border may not match up with the edges of the planet properly.
This isn't a huge problem, as the barrier will be invisible in-game. You can offset this by manually adjusting the size of the barrier to 
your liking. It's still not going to be pretty, but it'll work just fine.<br><br>

<b>The Fun Begins...</b><br><br>
On to the fun part: designing your planet! From here on in it's up to you. Find a good ground texture, play with displacements, build landing
pads, buildings, bases, lakes, caves, whatever!<br><br>

One final tip before we call it a day, When you're making your Spacebuild map it's a good idea to build each planet on a separate map, rather
than building the whole map at once. Since by nature Spacebuild maps are so huge, a map full of really detailed planets will take a LONG time to compile.
Building each planet separately allows for faster compile times which makes it a LOT easier to debug and make quick changes to your planet.<br><br>

I'll be covering how to make the planet's atmosphere (SB2 & SB3) as well as creating exterior planet shells in separate tutorials.<br><br>
