<p id="entryheader">ATMOSPHERES, OR: LOGIC_CASES AND YOU</p>
<p id="entrytext">
You've spent hours painstakingly sculpting your displacements, placing your trees, building your launch platforms, and building your buildings.
Now that your brand new planet is complete, the next step is to set up its atmosphere. Spacebuild atmospheres are defined by a logic_case entity
located at the center of the planet. These logic_cases simply contain values such as the radius of the planet, how strong the gravity should be,
temperature in the shade or in the light, and in the case of Spacebuild 3 the percentage of Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and finally,
the name of the planet. To begin, simply create a logic_case entity and place it at the center of your planet.<br><br>

<img src="images/atmospheres/image01.png"><br><br>

Open up the properties for the logic_case, and you'll see a list of Case 01, Case02, etc and blank spots to specify their values. This is where you'll
define the environment of your planet.<br><br>

<b>Spacebuild 2</b><br><br>

Spacebuild 3 may be the current version of Spacebuild, but don't count out Spacebuild 2. SB2 is still fairly popular, and your time wouldn't be wasted
by making versions of your map for both gamemodes. The following table will show you how to enter your values into the logic_case entity.<br><br>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Logic Case</th>
<th>Environment Data</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Case 01</b></td>
<td>planet</td>
<td>Tells SB2 that this is planet. Should just say 'planet'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Case 02</b></td>
<td>Radius</td>
<td>The radius of the planet. This is half of the planet's diameter, so a planet with a diameter of 4096 would have a radius of 2048</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Case 03</b></td>
<td>Gravity</td>
<td>A value of '1' here means earth gravity. '.5' would be half earth's gravity, and '2' is double.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Case 04</b></td>
<td>Pressure</td>
<td>'1' is earth pressure. Anything above '1' will crush you!</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 05</b></td>
<td>Temperature</td>
<td>288 is earth temperature, 14 is space. Burn damage will begin at 300, and will increase as the number goes up.</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 06</b></td>
<td>Temperature (Shade)</td>
<td>Same as above, but applies to players in the shade.</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 16</b></td>
<td>Flags</td>
<td>These are special attributes of a planet. See the next table below for a list of the flags and their uses.</td>
</tr>
</table><br><br>

Case 16 contains flags that define special attributes of the planet in question. These flags tell the gamemode if the planet is habitable, or 
if it is a burning planet (instant death!), or if there are earthquakes. The flags' numbers are defined in the table below: <br><br>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>0</b></td>
<td>No Flags</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1</b></td>
<td>Habitable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td>Quakes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>3</b></td>
<td>Habitable and Quakes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>4</b></td>
<td>Sun Burns</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>5</b></td>
<td>Habitable and Sun Burns</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>6</b></td>
<td>Sun Burns and Quakes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>7</b></td>
<td>Habitable, Sun Burns and Quakes</td>
</tr>
</table><br><br>

<b>Spacebuild 3</b><br><br>

The major difference that Spacebuild 3 brings to the table is the addition of dynamic environments. Essentially, each planet can have a
percentage of four gasses: Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide. During gameplay, these values can be modified by the player through 
the use of compressors and terraforming equipment. The following table describes how to configure your logic_case to work with Spacebuild 3.
<br><br>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Logic Case</th>
<th>Environment Data</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Case 01</b></td>
<td>planet2</td>
<td>Tells SB3 that this is planet. Should just say 'planet2'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Case 02</b></td>
<td>Radius</td>
<td>The radius of the planet. This is half of the planet's diameter, so a planet with a diameter of 4096 would have a radius of 2048</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Case 03</b></td>
<td>Gravity</td>
<td>A value of '1' here means earth gravity. '.5' would be half earth's gravity, and '2' is double.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Case 04</b></td>
<td>Atmosphere</td>
<td>This value controls the density of the planet's atmosphere, making the quantity of available gasses adjustable. Use '1' as a standard earth baseline</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 05</b></td>
<td>Pressure</td>
<td>Can be used to create planets with crushing atmospheres. Values above '1' deal damage on an increasing scale</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 06</b></td>
<td>Temperature (Shade)</td>
<td>Same as below, but applies to players in the shade.</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 07</b></td>
<td>Temperature</td>
<td>288 is earth temperature, 14 is space. Burn damage will begin at 300, and will increase as the number goes up.</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 08</b></td>
<td>Flags</td>
<td>These are special attributes of a planet. See the next table below for a list of the flags and their uses.</td>
</tr>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 09</b></td>
<td>O2 Percentage</td>
<td>Percentage of Oxygen available on a planet.</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 10</b></td>
<td>CO2 Percentage</td>
<td>Percentage of Carbon Dioxide available on a planet.</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 11</b></td>
<td>N Percentage</td>
<td>Percentage of Nitrogen available on a planet.</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 12</b></td>
<td>H Percentage</td>
<td>Percentage of Hydrogen available on a planet.</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Case 13</b></td>
<td>Planet Name</td>
<td>Enter the name of your planet and it will appear whenever the player arrives at your planet!</td>
</tr>
</table><br><br>

Case 08 contains flags that define special attributes of the planet in question. These flags tell the gamemode if the planet is a burning planet
(instant death!), or if there are earthquakes. The flags' numbers are defined in the table below: <br><br>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>0</b></td>
<td>No Flags</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1</b></td>
<td>Quakes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td>Sun Burns</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>3</b></td>
<td>Sun Burns and Quakes</td>
</tr>
</table><br><br>

<b>Layered Environments</b><br><br>
In Spacebuild 2 & 3 you can create layered environments, meaning you can have an environment within an environment! For example
if you create a large environment without oxygen on a planet, and then place a smaller environment which contains oxygen <i>inside</i>
the original environment, you will have a small habitable 'bubble' inside the larger uninhabitable environment.<br><br>

Well, those are the basics. Have fun creating unique environments!<br><br>
